This document will guide you through the compiling process.

== Linux

=== Prerequisites

* You need the development files for Qt 5.8 or newer.
* You will need the development files for websocket and serialport libraries that goes with your Qt version
* You can either use the Qbs build tool or the regular qmake build too to build it. QMake is simpler to use.

=== Compiling the GUI version (default)

[source,bash]
----
qmake QUsb2snes.pro CONFIG+='release'
make
----

Then start the QUsb2Snes binary directory that is created.

=== Compiling without GUI

If you want to build a version that does not use a Gui (to use it without a XServer):

[source,bash]
----
qmake "QUSB2SNES_NOGUI=1" CONFIG+='release'
make
----

== Windows

=== Prerequisites

* Install Qt 5
* Open the `.qbs` file with QCreator

== MacOS

TBD
