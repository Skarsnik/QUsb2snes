# QUsb2snes

QUsb2Snes is a websocket server that provide an unified protocol for accessing hardware/software that act like a SNES (or are a SNES). A classic usage is to use the FileViewer client to upload roms to your SD2SNES.
But it allows for more advanced usage like reading/writing the memory of the SNES.

## Usage

This repository only have QUsb2Snes and a file viewer application. If you want the full experience go [Usb2Snes project](https://github.com/usb2snes/usb2snes/releases).
Otherwise, download the latest release of [QUsb2Snes](https://github.com/Skarsnik/QUsb2snes/releases).

## SD2Snes

You need to install the last Usb2Snes firmware by Redguyyy (https://github.com/RedGuyyyy/sd2snes/releases/) . Just follows the instruction provided. Don't start usb2snes.exe since QUsb2snes do the same thing that the original software. Your sd2snes device should show up on the Devices menu when connected.

## SNES9x Rerecording

Snes9x-rr allows to run Lua scripts in the emulator, that allows the emulator to connect to QUsb2snes. You can use the Multitroid version of Snes9x-rr (http://multitroid.com/) or use Snes9x-rr 1.60 https://github.com/gocha/snes9x-rr/releases. Older version of Snes9x-rr does not allow to write to ROM from Lua so some application will not work.

Activate the `Lua bridge` on the device menu of QUsb2Snes.
Then run the luabridge.lua script from the LuaBridge folder from the Lua console window in Snes9x

## BizHawk 2.3.1 (bsnes core recommanded)

In the device menu of QUsb2Snes activate the `Lua bridge`

You will need to change the Lua support on the emulator. Go into the `Config -> Customize` menu then goes into the Advanced tab and select `Lua+LuaInterface` at the bottom in the Lua core part. Restart the emulator.
In the Lua directory of BizHawk create a `lua_bridge` directory (or a similar name) then copy the content of the LuaBridge directory from QUsb2Snes (the lua file and the dll file).
Run your game and then in the `Tools` menu start the `Lua console` click on the folder icon to load the `multibridge.lua` file. You need to close the Lua console if you want to disconnect properly.

## RetroArch with Snes core

You can use Snex9x (not recommanded) or bsnes-mercury cores. You need to activate the network command support, etheir in the configuration menu of RetroArch or editing your `retroarch.cfg` file (can be found in %appData%\RetroArch) to set `network_cmd_enable = "true"` (default is false). Then you need to activate the RetroArch virtual device on the devices menu. Any flavor of bsnes-mercury is prefered as we can access the ROM data.

Snex9x core : For software needing to the patch the ROM (multitroid for example) you etheir need to patch the rom manually with the IPS file or put the IPS file along side the rom with the same name for retroarch to auto patch it.

You can connect to a remote RetroArch by adding a `RetroArchHosts="remoteName=ip"` in the config file. If you want to add multiple hosts, just add ; between each host definition.


## SNES classic (called also SNES mini)

If for some reason your SNES classic does not have the expected IP address (connected via wifi or something) you can add a `SNESClassicIP=myip` in the config.ini file.

### Native emulator (canoe)

Mostly tested with Super Metroid.

Enable the SNES classic support on the device menu.

You need to 'hack' your SNES classic with the Hakchi2 CE version (https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/hakchi2/releases/) then remove the covershell mod if needed (as explained in https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/hakchi2/releases/tag/v3.4.0). 

Install the `serverstuff` mod provided by QUsb2snes: copy the `serverstuff.hmod` to the `user_mods` directory on Hakchi2, then install the mod with Hakchi2

Start the game and check if the SNES classic appear on the Devices menu, it should display something like `SNES classic : no client connected`. If not, try restarting the game.

It will not work with the 'normal' Hakchi2 version as the Hakchi2 CE provide a more stable way to access the SNES Classic.


### RetroArch

Enable the RetroArch support. Open Hakchi2 CE and in the menu go to 'tools -> open ftp client' it should open your default browser, copy paste the url it should look like `ftp://169.254.13.37/` for the default ip, and paste in the file explorer to go to it (if it ask you for user/password, just put root as user, there is no password). Go into the `/etc/libretro/` folder and copy the retroarch.cgf file somewhere. Open the copy with a text editor and search for the `network_cmd_enable` entry, replace `false` with `true`, save. Then now put your copy in place of the original one.


## BSnes-AS

Activate the `Lua bridge` on the device menu of QUsb2Snes.
In the `Script` menu of Bsnes-as, select `Load Script` and pick the usb2snes.as file from the included scripts folder.
